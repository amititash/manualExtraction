Many electronic components on your vehicle are equipped with data memories that temporarily or permanently store technical information about the condition of the vehicle , events and faults . . This technical information generally documents the state of a component , a module , a system or the environment :    . Operating states of system components , fill levels for instance .    Status messages for the vehicle and from its individual components , e.g. , wheel rotation speed/ vehicle speed , deceleration , transverse acceleration .    . Malfunctions and faults in important system components , e.g. , lights and brakes .    . Responses by the vehicle to special situations , e.g. , deployment of an airbag , engagement of stability control systems .    Ambient conditions , such as temperature . . This data is purely technical in nature and is used to detect and correct faults and to optimize vehicle functions . Motion profiles over routes traveled can not be created from this data . . When service offerings are used , e.g. , repair services , service processes , warranty claims , quality assurance , this technical information can be read out from the event and fault memories by the service personnel , including the manufacturer , using special diagnostic tools . . You can obtain further information there if it is needed . . After a fault is corrected , the information in the fault memory is deleted or overwritten on a continuous basis . . When the vehicle is in use , situations are conceivable in which it might be possible to associate this technical data with individuals if it is combined with other information , e.g. , an accident report , damage to the vehicle , eye witness accounts   possibly with the assistance of an expert . Additional functions that are contractually agreed with the customer , such as vehicle locating in an emergency , enable certain vehicle data to be transmitted from the vehicle .. .

This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder EDR . . The main purpose of an EDR is to record , in certain crash or near crash - like situations , such as an air bag deployment or hitting a road obstacle , data that will assist in understanding how a vehicles systems performed . . The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time , typically 30 seconds or less . . The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as :    . How various systems in your vehicle were operating .    . Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were fastened .    . How far , if at all , the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal .    . How fast the vehicle was traveling . . These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur . EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a nontrivial crash situation occurs ; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data , e.g. , name , gender , age , and crash location , are recorded . . However , other parties , such as law enforcement , could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation . . To read data recorded by an EDR , special equipment is required , and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed . . In addition to the vehicle manufacturer , other parties , such as law enforcement , that have the special equipment , can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR .. .

Possible driving distance with complete loss of tire inflation pressure : . The possible driving distance after a loss of tire inflation pressure depends on the cargo load and the driving style and conditions . . For a vehicle containing an average load , the possible driving distance is approx . 50 miles/80 km . . When the vehicle is driven with a damaged tire , its handling characteristics change , e.g. , reduced lane stability during braking , a longer braking distance , and altered self - steering properties . . Adjust your driving style accordingly . . Avoid abrupt steering maneuvers or driving over obstacles , e.g. , curbs , potholes , etc . . Because the possible driving distance depends on how the vehicle is used during the trip , the actual distance may be smaller or greater depending on the driving speed , road conditions , external temperature , cargo load , etc . . Continued driving with a flat tire . Drive moderately and do not exceed a speed of 50 mph/80 km / h . .

Each tire , including the spare ( if provided ) should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label . ( . If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label , you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires . ) . As an added safety feature , your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system ( TPMS ) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is significantly under - inflated . . Accordingly , when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates , you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible , and inflate them to the proper pressure . . Driving on a significantly under - inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure . . Under - inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life , and may affect the vehicle 's handling and stopping ability . . Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance , and it is the driver 's responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure , even if under - inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale . . Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly . . The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale . . When the system detects a malfunction , the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated . . This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start - ups as long as the malfunction exists . . When the malfunction indicator is illuminated , the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended . TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons , including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly . . Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly .. .
